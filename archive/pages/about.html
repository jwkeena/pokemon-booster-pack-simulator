      <h3 class="title">WANT TO SEE MORE SETS?</h3>
      I am aware of the demand for more sets! The biggest encouragement for me
      to add more is for the site to reach a wider audience. I'd love to add
      more, the bigger the audience gets; so
      <a href="/pages/archive-index.html">share</a> the site with friends who would enjoy
      it. If there are particular ones you want to see arrive first
      <a href="javascript:void();" onclick="redirect()">email me</a>. However, I
      won't add any that are currently
      <a href="https://www.ptcgoshop.com/card-packs">being monetized</a>
      by the Pokemon Trading Card Game Online. I'm strictly interested in
      historical preservation, and re-creating the experience of opening these
      packs.

      <h3 class="title">WANT TO REQUEST A NEW FEATURE OR RULE?</h3>
      Many of the features on the simulator, such as the same set button and the
      zoom ability, were user requests. Let me know what you'd like to see, and
      I'll see if I can add it.
      <br />
      <br />If you're submitting a new card distribution rule, check the list
      below to see what's already been implemented. Again, the best place to
      reach me currently is on

      When shuffle is turned off, cards will always appear in the following
      order:
      <ol>
        <li>Base: 7 commons (2 of which are energy), 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>
        <li>Jungle: 7 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>

        <li>
          Expedition Base: 5 commons (holo pull replaces 5th common), 1 reverse
          holo (any rarity), 1 regular rare, 2 uncommons

      These patterns have been extracted from numerous YouTube booster pack
      openings.

      <h3 class="title">DUPLICATES</h3>
      Duplicates have been prevented in the simulator, since they aren't meant
      to occur in physical packs. In the original 11 sets, it is possible to
      pull two of the same pokemon, but not with the identical art or card
      number. In the expedition base set, it is possible to pull three of the
      same pokemon with the same art and card number, but of different rarity
      tiers: holographic, reverse holographic, and regular rare.
