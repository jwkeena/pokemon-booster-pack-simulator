# pokemon-booster-pack-simulator
Made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this web application accurately captures the probability, rarity distribution, and experience of the first dozen+ sets.

# goals
The only way to open original packs of actual Pokemon cards is either to spend hundreds of dollars on eBay or to watch YouTubers enjoy the process for you. I wanted to recreate that experience virtually and for free. It's now one of the most popular sites on Neocities. Mobile responsive.

# try it yourself!
